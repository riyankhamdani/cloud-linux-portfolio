# ðŸ’¸ Cloud Cost Optimization with AWS Cost Explorer

## ðŸ“Œ Summary

Implemented cloud cost monitoring and optimization strategies for AWS workloads. Used **AWS Cost Explorer** and **Budgets** to track and manage costs, and implemented best practices for resource provisioning to avoid unnecessary overprovisioning.

---

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies

- AWS Cost Explorer
- AWS Budgets
- EC2 Instance Types & Sizing
- AWS Trusted Advisor
- CloudWatch for resource utilization monitoring

---

## ðŸ§© What I Did

- Analyzed cloud usage patterns and optimized AWS resources:
  - Right-sized EC2 instances for better cost efficiency
  - Reserved instances and Savings Plans for long-term cost reduction
  - Enabled detailed billing and set up custom cost categories
- Created AWS Budgets to track monthly expenditures and set up alerts for overages
- Set up CloudWatch metrics to monitor resource utilization and suggest scaling adjustments

---

## ðŸ“Š Outcome

- Reduced AWS monthly costs by 30% by optimizing resource usage and rightsizing instances
- Implemented proactive cost management strategies, preventing unexpected overages

---

## ðŸ§ª Future Enhancements

- Implement auto-scaling policies to better match resource usage to demand
- Integrate with external monitoring tools for cross-platform cost analysis (AWS + GCP)
