## 🧪 DR Test Scenarios

| Scenario | Tools Used | Result |
|---------|------------|--------|
| Full site failover | Zerto | ✅ Success under 15 min |
| File-level restore | Acronis | ✅ Recovery from image |
| Network mapping between sites | Zerto + Mikrotik | ✅ Preserved during failover |
| Recovery plan execution | Zerto | ✅ No data loss |
