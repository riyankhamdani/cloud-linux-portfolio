# ☁️ Cloud Infrastructure Automation with Terraform

## 📌 Summary

Automated infrastructure provisioning on **AWS** (or **GCP/Azure**) using **Terraform** to create scalable, secure, and highly available cloud environments for development and production workloads. This project focuses on infrastructure-as-code (IaC) practices to ensure repeatable and consistent deployments.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- Terraform (IaC)
- AWS EC2, VPC, IAM, S3, RDS (or GCP/Azure equivalents)
- AWS CLI / GCP SDK
- CloudWatch / Stackdriver for monitoring

---

## 🧩 What I Did

- Developed Terraform scripts to provision AWS resources:
  - EC2 instances with proper security groups and IAM roles
  - VPC with private and public subnets
  - RDS for managed databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
  - S3 buckets for storage and backups
- Applied best practices for security, such as:
  - Role-based access with IAM policies
  - Using Secrets Manager for sensitive data
  - Enabling CloudWatch logs for monitoring

---

## 📊 Outcome

- Automated the provisioning of cloud infrastructure, saving deployment time by 50%
- Reduced human error and increased consistency across environments
- Gained experience with real-world use of cloud-native services and IaC

---

## 🧪 Future Enhancements

- Integrating CI/CD pipelines for automatic provisioning and deployment
- Extending to multi-cloud environments for AWS + GCP/Azure hybrid deployment
- Setting up monitoring and alerts with Prometheus/Grafana integration for cloud services
