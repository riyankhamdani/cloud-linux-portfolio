# ðŸš€ Serverless Application with AWS Lambda

## ðŸ“Œ Summary

Developed a serverless application using **AWS Lambda** to run compute workloads without provisioning or managing servers. The application uses **API Gateway** for HTTP requests, **DynamoDB** for storage, and **SNS** for notifications.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies

- AWS Lambda
- API Gateway
- DynamoDB
- SNS (Simple Notification Service)
- CloudFormation (for IaC)
- AWS CLI / SDK

---

## ðŸ§© What I Did

- Designed and developed Lambda functions to handle HTTP requests and data processing tasks
- Used **API Gateway** to expose Lambda functions as RESTful APIs
- Stored application data in **DynamoDB** for low-latency access
- Configured **SNS** for notifications and alerts to users
- Deployed all infrastructure using **CloudFormation** for infrastructure-as-code

---

## ðŸ“Š Outcome

- Developed a scalable, low-cost application with no servers to manage
- Increased deployment speed and flexibility with serverless architecture

---

## ðŸ§ª Future Enhancements

- Integrating with **AWS Step Functions** for workflow orchestration
- Improving API security with **AWS Cognito** authentication
